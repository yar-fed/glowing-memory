## Already accomplished
 - subtask 1 (Set a new reminder. Specify user name, message text and delay in seconds relative to the current moment)
 - subtask 2 (Get reminders for the current user. Specify user name)
 - only 1 timer used for measuring delays
 - a memory pool is used to store raw reminder data (cleared manually)
 - kernel lists are used for storing pointers to raw data and processed data (e.g. numeric delay parsed from string)
